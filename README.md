# spring-kotlin-jwt-redis-template

A clean and extensible Spring Boot project template written in **Kotlin**, built with **Hexagonal Architecture**, **DDD principles**, and secure authentication using **JWT** and **Redis**.

## ðŸ§± Architecture

This project follows the **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**, which enables strong separation of concerns and easier maintainability.

```plaintext
â”œâ”€â”€ adapter â”‚ 
   â”œâ”€â”€ in-web # REST controllers 
   â””â”€â”€ out-persistent # JPA/Hibernate persistence adapters 
â”œâ”€â”€ application 
   â”œâ”€â”€ port # Application layer interfaces
      â”œâ”€â”€ in # UseCase interfaces  
      â””â”€â”€ out # Persistence abstraction (e.g., save/load) 
   â””â”€â”€ service # Application service implementations
â””â”€â”€ domain # Core domain model (entities, logic) 
```

### ðŸš§ Notice
Only sign-up and duplicate email check features have been implemented at this stage.
Please consider refactoring and extending for more detailed functionalities in the future.
